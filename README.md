 ðŸŒŸ Projects
 
 Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on:

 1. QR Code generation with Stable Diffusion
    
	â€¢	Description:

		â€¢	A QR code generator powered by generative AI automates the creation of Quick Response (QR) codes.
		â€¢	It streamlines data sharing and accessibility by using algorithms to encode data into QR codes.
		â€¢	These AI-driven systems make linking physical objects to digital content easier.

	â€¢	Technologies:

			Stable diffusion, ControlNet, qrcode

 3. AI-Powered Image Caption Generator
    
	â€¢	Description:

		   â€¢	Objective: Leverages image processing and deep learning to generate engaging captions for images, essential for social media and digital marketing.
		   â€¢	Function: Manages large datasets of correlated photos and captions to comprehend images and use AI for generating relevant and compelling captions.

	â€¢	Technologies:

			Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNN, RNN, BEAM Search, MSCOCO, Flickr8k, Flickr30k, PASCAL 1K, AI Challenger Dataset, STAIR Captions
